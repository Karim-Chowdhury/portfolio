            <p>To start, let’s look at a selection of websites from public figures. Some are YouTubers and podcasters, others are the CEOs of large companies, and still others are acclaimed novelists. All of them, however, have excellent websites that have a lot to teach us about website creation.</p>

             <p>Computer programmers can earn anywhere from an associate’s degree to a master’s degree to reach some of the best computer programming jobs in today’s marketplace.  Computer programming degrees include software development, information technology, computer systems, and more.  Students may also consider pursuing a minor outside of computer science to add to their CS major to expand their career versatility.  If you are already working in the industry and want to pursue a degree, consider an online computer science degree or certificate program.</p>
